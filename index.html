                when first assuming the Perfected Ultra Instinct, Goku is covered in a bright white sheen, while his features are painted black and blue, 
                and his hairstyle appears similar to his Super Saiyan form.

                    <li>This form is essentially identical to the initial state of Ultra Instinct Sign, albeit with the user's hair becoming silver in color. </li>
                    <li>The hairstyle is slightly wilder and more solid than normal, having no loose strands.</li>
                    <li>The eyes take on a more stern, defined shape, sporting silver-colored irises, and visible pupils.</li>
                    <li>Also, in the manga, the user generally has a focused but calm expression.</li>
